# Introduction
Shekels is a local service which consumes a transactions CSV file downloaded
from mint.intuit.com. It conforms this data into a database, and displays it as
a searchable table and dashboard of configurable plots in web frontend.

See [documentation](https://thenewflesh.github.io/shekels/) for details.

On the documentation main page, under the *Architecture* section, is a
dynamically generated dependency graph of shekels's current architecture.
It is generated using the RepoETL class.

If you look under the *Metrics* section you will find Radon code metric plots
and data of the shekels source code, generated by the RadonETL class.
